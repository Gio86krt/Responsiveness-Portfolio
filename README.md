# Updated Portfolio

- Updated portfolio with info and pictures;

- The Portfolio page displays a gallery with recent works, and clicking on the image will link to the deployed application;

- Added a script to diplay a "quote of the day" in the index page, an external API is used, this particular API has a limited number of daily calls, so when the maximum number of calls is exceeded an array of quotes is used to display the quote;

- In the portfolio added a side section with a list of what I'm working on, it will be updated when needed;

- In the contact section added links to LinkedIn, GitHub and to download the resume;
